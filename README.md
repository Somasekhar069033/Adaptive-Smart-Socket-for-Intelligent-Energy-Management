# Adaptive-Smart-Socket-for-Intelligent-Energy-Management
Traditional sockets lack smart control, leading to unnecessary energy drain, inefficiency, and standby power loss. This project proposes the **Adaptive Smart Socket**, a low-cost, Wi-Fi-enabled, intelligent system built around the ESP8266 microcontroller. It provides wireless control, real-time monitoring, OTA firmware updates, and load schedULING
