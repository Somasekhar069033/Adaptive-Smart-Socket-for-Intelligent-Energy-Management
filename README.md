## 📄 Abstract

Traditional electrical sockets come with major limitations in energy efficiency and smart control, especially in industrial and domestic environments. These sockets often cause unnecessary energy drain, even when appliances are on standby, leading to increased power loss, operational costs, and shorter appliance lifespans.

This project introduces the **Adaptive Smart Socket**, a cost-effective and user-friendly embedded system designed to tackle these inefficiencies. Built around the **ESP-8266 microcontroller**, the smart socket enables:

- **Wireless control**
- **Real-time energy monitoring**
- **Scheduling capabilities**
- **Over-the-Air (OTA) firmware updates**
- **Web View Configuration for easy access**

The system was designed and simulated using **EasyEDA**, fabricated in a laboratory setting, and tested in real-world conditions to validate performance. Results showed significant reductions in energy waste, improved power distribution, and enhanced user control.

With its low-cost design, OTA upgradability, and scalable architecture, the proposed smart socket offers a modern and sustainable solution for **intelligent energy management** in both homes and industries.
## 🧭 Introduction

Electrical sockets are essential in daily life, powering appliances in homes and industries. However, traditional sockets operate with basic ON/OFF mechanisms and **lack smart control features**, resulting in:

- Continuous energy draw in standby mode
- High electricity bills
- Reduced appliance lifespan
- Manual switching inconvenience

With the rise of **smart home automation**, smart sockets are becoming popular. Yet, many suffer from:

- Complicated setups
- Poor user interfaces
- Network disconnections
- No firmware upgrade support

To address these issues, this research introduces the **Adaptive Smart Socket** — a Wi-Fi-enabled socket built with the **ESP-8266 microcontroller**, featuring:

- Real-time energy monitoring
- Wireless control
- OTA updates
- WebView-based configuration for ease of use

The system was designed in **EasyEDA**, fabricated in the lab, and tested under real-world conditions.
